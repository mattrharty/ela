<center><strong><h1 class="title">Art's Reflection of Time Periods</h1></strong></center>

<center class="center">
  Throughout the ages, humans have used art to express themselves as well as the world around them during times of crisis. This can especially be seen during epidemics where artists are isolated with likely not much more than disease and their crafts were one their minds. Historians can gain better insight into how art may reflect a time period by comparing the recent Covid-19 Pandemic with seemingly ancient Bubonic Plague. One of the more contrasting aspects of the two periods’ art pieces was the overall tone. Art during the Bubonic Plague had a generally oppressive and depressing tone, many focusing on death and conflict while Covid-19 Pandemic hosted art with bright colors as wells as impllications of hope and a persistent effort to stay connected to others. Both periods were very sad for many in a plethora of ways, however it seems artists during Covid-19 hoped to focus on the brighter side, possibly with the purpose of cheering up their audience. Despite these differences, both disease outbreaks have arts that generally reflect the lifestyles people had to live at the time. During the Bubonic Plague, the art shows the constant risk of death encroaching on anyone and Covid-19 art showed off impact of isolation and the importance of healthcare workers.

  <center><strong><h1 class="title">Enduring Issues</h1></strong></center>

<center class="center">Throughout history, enduring issues have plagued civilizations and despite our efforts to stop them they continue to persevere. From artificial issues like that of discrimination made in society that we brought upon ourselves to natural issues like disease that are out of our hands, these enduring issues have proved themselves to be troublesome to say the least. In particular, power, from its abuse to its unjust distribution, is an issue that has been the root cause of many problems for many civilizations. The abuse and discriminatory distribution of power is a significant enduring issue because people in power are often prone to taking actions to suppress anything or anyone that threatens their power or position in society by creating oppression based on social status, demonstrated by the development of Christianity, the Hindu Caste System, and Confucianist relationships.

<center class="center">The abuse and unjust distribution of power is clearly apparent in the biginnings of Christianity. As Christianity developed, powerful merchants felt it threatened their business in Mecca and made large efforts to put the newfound religion to a stop. In Helmut Koester, it states “And if you’re at the bottom of that social pyramid, not a whole lot of things are coming down to you anymore and life is hard with little hope…” In the Roman Empire at the time, your social status how you were treated and your power in society, meaning those at the bottom received very little of such. As time went on, the lower classes grew with discontent as the higher classes continued their efforts of oppression upon them. The lower classes required hope and Christianity provided that in the form of the idea of God seeing everyone qual and it gives dignity to even the least powerful, like slaves. The oppression by the powerufl has continued to trouble us as in many ways it can be seen today, however, it has improved over time as minorities have gained representation.

<center class="center">The discriminatory distribution of power cna be seen in the sociel structure in Hindu and Indian society. In early India, leaders organized society into classes called castes in order to restrict social mobility and keep themselves in charge. In “Analysis of the Law of Manu”, it is seen that “Dalits, or untouchables… laboured at jobs considered demeaning or taboo for the four classes” and they were “not even acknowledged in religious writing.” This caste system stuck many at or near the bottom in society in order to keep those up top powerful. There have been many who were born with great potential they never achieved because they were deemed and “untouchable” at birth. On top of this, the caste system strips Dalits of their dignity, drains the Brahmin of thier humaniy, and isnks the population in poverty. In recent times, the Indian government has taken large strides towards removing the caste system, but discrimination between the castes still perserveres.

<center class="center">The distribution of power is also demonstrated in a Confucianist society. As the Warring States came to an end, people desired direction and order, so they began following a chinese philosopher, Confucius. According to the “Analects”, “A young man’s duty is to behavee well to his… elders”. In this excerpt, “elders” does not only refer to one’s older family members, but alos to the government. Leaders used this to ensure the people stayed in their place and did not rebel against the government. That being said, it did work. The people respected their government and the government served the people. This led to a long period of peace and general docility among the public. This people-government relationship can be seen in most countries today as we trust those who govern us with many aspects of the world around us and, more times than not, they fulfill our expectations.
</center>
<center class="center">As seen around Christianity, the Hindu Caste System, and the Confucianism, the abuse and discriminitory distribution of power proves to be an ever-prevelant, significant enduring issue. Although democracy has widely spread out power to the people, there are still many areas in the world where power is being misused. Based on the abuse of power, we can learn to be sure to, as a species, work towards a world consisting of leaders who only use their power according to their people’s wants and needs. The misuse of power will likely continue to impact us negatively , oppressing certain groups of people and hindering progress, until we are able to configure society in such a way in which everyone has power.
