<center class="center">
  The IBO defines a global issue as one that has significance on a large scale, transnational meaning the global issue is not happening in just one place or country, and the global issue is also felt in everyday contexts.
</center>
<center class="center">
  In other words, a global issue is a global issue when there is a problem that can be seen everywhere. Global issues should not be hard to find in the world around you as they’re issues that everyone experiences. They are not limited to certain countries or rare occurrences.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Within my IO, I will analyze the global issue centered around the concept of inherited conflict as barriers faced in relationships and present barriers faced in relationships as a global issue, as defined by the IBO, because this is seen everywhere as relationships of any kind, friendship, romantic, family, runs into barriers that are either avoided, overcome, or are overcome by as they are too strong. Depending on the relationship and the barrier, this can have great effect upon the people in the relationship and even others that may be involved.
</center>
<center class="center">
  I believe inherited conflict as barriers faced in relationships is a global issue, as defined by the IBO, because this isssue is felt everywhere by everyone as everyone has relationships and those relationships run into barriers. Some minor barriers are seen everyday in the form of small disagreements as well as larger barriers that often reveal themselves rarely.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Furthermore, I will validate my position that inherited conflict as barriers faced in relationships are a global issue, with my original analysis of an excerpt from William Shakespeare’s 16th century dramatic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet.
</center>
<center class="center">
  An analysis of Shakespeare’s use of conflict, in Act III, Scene ii, Lines 69-75, highlights the viability for one to consider the inherited conflict as barriers faced in relationships as a global issue so the audience can realize that if relationships are desired to last, they must persevere through many disagreements between the relationship participants.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Prior to discussing my excerpt from Shakespeare’s drama, it is important to note, Shakespeare had written many literary works before Romeo and Juliet. Many of which were tragedies, as were popular at the time. His works often did not stray much too different from Romeo and Juliet.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Now, I would like to share the specifics of the excerpt I will use to support the legitimacy of a global issue like the existence of barriers in relationships. 
</center>
<center class="center">
  In this excerpt from Act III, scene ii, lines 69-75, Shakespeare includes the characters, Juliet and Nurse.
</center>
<center class="center">
  The excerpt centers around the nurse clarifying to Juliet that Romeo killed Tybalt and is now banished. Juliet begins to doubt her love for Romeo.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Within this excerpt, I’d like to bring your attention to a specific part I believe supports the position that inherited conflict as barriers faced in relationships are a global issue worthy of attention.
</center>
  <center class="center">
  In lines 69-75, and the excerpt states, “Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banishèd; Romeo that killed him, he is banishèd. Juliet. O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? Nurse. It did, it did, alas the day, it did! Juliet. O serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face! Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,”.
</center>
<center class="center">
  At this moment, the nurse details to Juliet about how Romeo had been banished after he had murdered Tybalt and Juliet feels conflicted about her love for Romeo.
</center>
<center class="center">
  This is a relevant piece of text because the excerpt reveals Shakespeare’s use of conflict which can be defined as the author’s use of a disagreement between characters in order to get a point across to the reader.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Shakespeare uses antonyms like “tyrant” and “angelical” which is characteristic of conflicts because they displays ideas that do not agree with each other.
</center>
<center class="center">
  One can hypothesize Shakespeare’s use of conflict has a greater purpose beyond its role in the plot progression of the play.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Shakespeare uses conflict to convey the theme, or message, of how large of a hurdle inherited conflict can serve towards a relationship because he wants his audience to careful with their actions and be mindful of the background they have with those they care about and with this thematic understanding, the reader/viewer/audience can better understand the weight of one’s actions and how it can cause doubts in the relationship.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Furthermore, a hypothesis centered around Shakespeare’s rationale helps to support the validity of the barriers faced in relationships as a global issue because it provides insight of how relationships in fictional works can correlate to the real world, demonstrating rather extreme barriers and how their overcome.
</center>
<center class="center">
  Therefore, an analysis of Shakespeare’s use of conflict helps bring awareness to the global issue of the barriers faced in relationships.
</center>
<center class="center">
  While this IO supports the presence of the global issue, as defined by the IBO, I believe there are ways to further justify this point through the use of other examples and the further analysis of other uses of literary devices that support the global issue seen throughout Romeo in Juliet.
