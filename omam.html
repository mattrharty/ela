<center><strong><h1 class="title">Placing a New Lens on Old Texts</h1></strong></center>

<center class="center">A 2023 analysis of a literary text and a non-literary text has the potential to greatly influence their audience and their understanding of text types, the world, and themselves as a deep analysis of these works reveals what lies beneath just a surface-level understanding of the piece and can often display some sort of theme or message. For example, Steinbeck's 1937 novella, <i>Of Mice and Men</i>, and the photograph, “Shoeshine Man”, taken by Rothstein in 1937 reinforce several themes relating to the American Dream and its significance during the Great Depression. Analyzing Steinbeck's use of literary elements such as symbolism or repetition can display messages to the reader about different approaches to the American Dream and how it can be perceived through the stories of the characters, George, Lennie, and Candy, and their time on a ranch, while in Rothstein's photograph of a shoe shiner working off the streets of New York, it can be seen that the use of visual rhetorical devices such as body language and focal points emphasize different perspectives on the American Dream just as effectively as Steinbeck had. By analyzing Steinbeck’s use of symbolism and motif and Rothstein’s use of body language, it can be seen that viewing literary and non-literary texts with a 2023 lens can greatly enhance the contemporary viewer’s understanding of their date of creation as well as today’s world and even a greater theme or message.

<center class="center">Authors utilize symbolism, a literary element, in order to convey a greater meaning or significance through the inclusion of everyday objects or creatures. In Steinbeck’s novella, soon after George and Lennie discuss their American Dream, Candy overhears George and Lennie discussing their plans for buying a farm of their own and he requests to join them. Candy states “‘Jus’ as soon as I can’t swamp out no bunkhouses they’ll put me on the country. Maybe if I give you guys my money, you’ll let me hoe in the garden even after I ain’t no good at it.’”(p. 60). In the following discussion, the three plan to purchase a farm of their own and keep it a secret from others. This excerpt reinforces how Candy’s American Dream lies in companionship. Earlier in the novella, Steinbeck uses Candy’s dog to symbolize this need for companionship. Now that the dog is dead, the farm and the three’s plan to live on said farm represent Candy’s dream for companionship similar to how it also symbolizes George and Lennie’s dream for independence. Therefore, Steinbeck's use of symbolism conveys the theme, or message, of the American Dream can come in a variety of ways depending on the reader, so the audience understands that their American Dream can differ greatly from others depending on wants and circumstances as George and Lennie want to live independently and, due to his old age and lacking quality as a worker, Candy requires companionship to continue surviving.

<center class="center">Motifs, a literary device, can be used by authors to convey or signify a specific message through the recurrence of a simple idea. Lennie describes his and the others’ plan to go live off a farm and Crooks replies by recalling all the men who had the American Dream stuck in their heads with no way of achieving it. Crooks continues on to say “‘A guy needs somebody - to be near him… A guy goes nuts if he ain’t got nobody. Don’t make no difference who the guy is, long’s he’s with you. I tell ya… I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets sick.’” (p. 72-73). Crooks follows on to offer to aid on the farm, but he is soon interrupted by George and Candy. In this excerpt, the motif of companionship is used as seen in Crook’s desire for it and his envy of Lennie’s relationship with George. Companionship appears many times prior to this excerpt as well in the form of George and Lennie as well as at first Candy and his dog and after the death of the dog, Candy seeks companionship in George and Lennie. Steinbeck used the motif of companionship throughout the novella in order to exhibit how companionship is a crucial aspect of the American Dream and the requirement for a connection to others to fully achieve the American Dream. Therefore, Steinbeck’s use of motif conveys the theme, or message, of companionship is a significant part of the American Dream and is a requirement for achieving it, so the audience understands that although everyone has their own version of the American Dream, and companionship is imperative to everyone’s as others are required in order to escape loneliness.

<center class="center">It is a commonly held belief that only literary texts are capable of greatly impacting their reader beyond a thematic understanding. However, further analysis of non-literary texts such as photographs can greatly impact the viewer in many crucial ways. Photographers can use body language and gaze, visual rhetorical devices, to convey ideas or emotions through the posture and the facial expressions of people in the image. In the 1930s, Arthur Rothstein worked for the US photo unit under President Franklin Roosevelt’s administration and he was tasked with capturing and publicizing the Great Depression’s effects all over the country. In 1937, he took a photograph of a shoe shiner sitting up against a wall and a subway station in New York titled “Shoeshine Man”. The man in the center of the photograph is sitting on a box next to a chair as well as a subway station and wall adorned with a sign detailing how a man must “be ready for his opportunity when it comes”. Examining the body language of the man, it can be seen that he is slouched over, has his arms crossed, and has an unhappy look adorning his face. Based on this, it can be concluded that he is not content with his current situation, however, he is taking an opportunity to shoe shine off the streets of New York for money. Arthur Rothstein’s use of body language conveys a theme, or message, associated with the motif of the American Dream. Rothstein’s message to his viewer is that even in the worst conditions, one must take opportunities when available, so the audience understands in order to achieve the American Dream, it is imperative to make the most out of every scenario.

<center class="center">Author John Steinbeck and photographer Arthur Rothstein, while representative of different genres of expression, collectively utilize genre-specific devices for an intended impact. Steinbeck uses motif and symbolism, while  Rothstein uses body language to convey the importance of taking opportunities during grim times in order to achieve one’s American Dream. A 2023 analysis of literary texts like Steinbeck’s <i>Of Mice and Men</i>, and non-literary texts like Rothstein’s “Shoeshine Man” suggests text types representative of different genres, but from the same space and time are capable of conveying powerful messages as seen in both of these works display complex ideas or themes regarding the American Dream and different approaches towards it such as seeking it in companions as seen in <i>Of Mice and Men</i> or the importance of seeking opportunities in the darkest times as seen in “Shoeshine Man”. Viewing these works with a present-day analysis, it can be seen that, although they were significant in their time, they can be just as relevant in today's world, and analyzing both non-literary and literary works can lead to a full understanding of their displayed topics as they are being represented in different ways through the use of different elements.
